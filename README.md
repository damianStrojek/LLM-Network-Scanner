# LLM-Network-Scanner

LLM-Network-Scanner is a powerful tool that leverages the OpenAI API and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to identify and scan network hosts. By using state-of-the-art language models, it automates the process of host discovery, vulnerability scanning, and network analysis. This tool helps network administrators efficiently assess and secure their infrastructure by providing intelligent insights, scanning results, and potential vulnerability reports for each identified host in the network.

Main functionalities:
- Create a custom welcoming banner
- Check the current status of given hosts
- Scan online hosts for open ports
- Perform a detailed scan on open ports
- Find out best tools to dive deeper into specific services
- Generate a custom summary in the image format

## Demo

Below is a screenshot from one of the development versions of LLM-Network-Scanner. In <span style="color:red">**red**</span>, you can see commands that were generated by OpenAI API and then executed locally on Kali Linux 2024.

## Testing

We have used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environement with [opencanary](https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary) instance to locally test Network Scanner.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up latest
```

Opencanary config files:

```bash
# docker-compose.yml
###
